## üìù Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Access BitLocker Drive Encryption

- Open **Control Panel** or navigate through **Settings**
- Locate and select **BitLocker Drive Encryption**
- Identify the System (C:) drive in the BitLocker interface

### Step 2: Enable BitLocker for System Drive

- Next to the System (C:) drive, click **Turn on BitLocker**
- Allow BitLocker to initialize and check system compatibility
- Verify TPM (Trusted Platform Module) is available and ready
- Proceed with BitLocker setup wizard

### Step 3: Configure Recovery Key Backup

- When prompted for recovery key backup options, select **Save to a network location**
- Navigate to the specified network path: **\CorpServer\BU-Office1**
- Save the BitLocker recovery key to the corporate backup folder
- Verify the recovery key file has been successfully created

### Step 4: Configure Encryption Settings

- Select **Encrypt entire drive** (not just used disk space)
- Choose **New encryption mode** when prompted for encryption compatibility
- This provides enhanced security for devices that won't be moved to older Windows versions
- Confirm encryption settings and options

### Step 5: Run BitLocker System Check

- Check the box for **Run BitLocker system check**
- This verifies that BitLocker can access the recovery keys and encryption keys correctly
- Click **Continue** to proceed with the system check
- System will require restart to complete the check

### Step 6: Complete Encryption Process

- Restart the computer when prompted
- Allow BitLocker system check to complete during boot
- After successful restart, encryption process will begin automatically
- Monitor encryption progress through BitLocker Drive Encryption interface
- Verify System (C:) drive shows as encrypted and protected

## üìö Key Takeaways

**Main Concepts Learned:**

1. BitLocker with TPM provides hardware-based encryption key protection, creating a secure boot environment that detects unauthorized system modifications.
    
2. Enterprise recovery key management requires centralized backup storage to ensure data recovery capabilities while maintaining security policies.
    
3. New encryption mode offers enhanced security algorithms optimized for modern systems that won't need backward compatibility with older Windows versions.
    
4. BitLocker system checks validate the entire encryption infrastructure before deployment, preventing potential boot failures or data loss scenarios.
    

**Real-World Application:**

- IT security administrators deploy BitLocker across corporate environments to meet compliance requirements for data protection, especially for mobile devices and sensitive workstations.
    
- Enterprise BitLocker implementations require proper recovery key management and backup procedures to balance security with business continuity, ensuring authorized data recovery while preventing unauthorized access.
