# 🧪 Lab: 011 Configure BIOS/UEFI Security

## 🎯 Lab Overview

**Objective:** Security hardening at firmware level - essential for enterprise security

**Skills Practiced:**
- Add admin password/Hard disk password
- Enable the TPM
- Enable chassis intrusion detection to show an alert during POST when an intrusion is detected

**CertMaster Environment:** Simulation/Virtual lab details

## 📝 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Restart the computer in the BIOS

- Press **F2** while the computer is booting.
### Step 2: Configure the following security settings

- Add an admin password used to make changes to BIOS settings
	- Password: **t67xab1**
- Add a password that prevents hard disk access even when the hard disk is moved to another system.
	- Password: **dog8b0b** (0 is a zero)
- Enable the TPM
- Enable chassis intrusion detection to show an alert during POST when an intrusion is detected
- Save the changes

### Step 3: Restart the computer to verify the changes

## 📚 Key Takeaways

**Main Concepts Learned:**

1. BIOS/UEFI security settings form the first line of defense against unauthorized system access—securing firmware prevents attackers from bypassing OS-level security.
    
2. Setting up admin and hard-disk passwords strengthens protection of both configuration integrity and data confidentiality, even if hardware is moved.
    
3. TPM (Trusted Platform Module) provides a foundation for encryption, secure boot, and identity verification, which are critical in enterprise environments.
    
4. Chassis intrusion detection adds a layer of physical security awareness, alerting administrators if the system case has been tampered with.
    

**Real-World Application:**

- These configurations are vital in enterprise security hardening, especially for preventing data theft, maintaining compliance, and ensuring device integrity.
    
- IT administrators regularly apply BIOS/UEFI protections in managed environments to guard against insider threats, physical attacks, and advanced malware that exploits firmware-level weaknesses.
