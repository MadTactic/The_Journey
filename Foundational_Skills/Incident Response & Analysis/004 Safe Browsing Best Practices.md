## üìù Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache Only

- Open **Google Chrome**
- Click the **kebab menu** (three vertical dots) in the top-right corner
- Select **Clear browsing data...**
- In the Clear browsing data modal:
    - Set time range to **All time**
    - **Uncheck** all options except **Cached images and files**
    - Ensure browsing history, cookies, and other data remain selected to **NOT** delete
- Click **Clear data** to remove only cached files

### Step 2: Navigate to Secure Website for Certificate Inspection

- Navigate to any secure website (https://) in the address bar
- Look for the **lock icon** or security indicator at the left side of the URL bar

### Step 3: View and Inspect Security Certificate

- Click the **security button/lock icon** at the left side of the URL bar
- Select **Connection is secure**
- Click **Certificate is valid** to view detailed certificate information
- Review certificate details including:
    - Issued to and issued by information
    - Validity period (valid from/to dates)
    - Certificate authority information
    - Encryption details

### Step 4: Complete Assessment Questions

- Use the simulated Chrome browser to answer multiple-choice questions
- Apply knowledge gained from certificate inspection and browser security features
- Verify answers using the certificate viewing process learned in previous steps

## üìö Key Takeaways

**Main Concepts Learned:**

1. Selective browser data clearing maintains user privacy while preserving important browsing data like saved passwords and site preferences.
    
2. SSL/TLS certificates provide cryptographic proof of website identity and establish secure communication channels between browsers and servers.
    
3. Certificate validation involves checking issuing authority, validity periods, and encryption standards to ensure legitimate website connections.
    
4. Browser security indicators (lock icons, certificate information) help users make informed decisions about website trustworthiness and data sharing.
    

**Real-World Application:**

- IT security training programs teach employees to recognize legitimate certificates and avoid phishing sites that use invalid or suspicious certificates.
    
- System administrators regularly clear browser caches on shared workstations to prevent data leakage while maintaining productivity through selective data preservation, and train users on certificate inspection as part of security awareness initiatives.
