## 📝 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Nmap Scanning Environment

- Access command line interface or terminal
- Verify **Nmap** installation and availability
- Prepare to scan target database server **192.168.0.22**

### Step 2: Execute Port Scan Against Database Server

- Run **Nmap** port scan command against **192.168.0.22**
- Use appropriate scanning parameters to identify open ports
- Allow scan to complete and capture all results

### Step 3: Analyze Scan Results

- Review Nmap output for **open ports** and running services
- Identify potential security risks from exposed services
- Document all discovered ports and associated service information
- Note any unexpected or unnecessary open ports

### Step 4: Document Findings and Assessment

- Complete lab assessment question based on scan results
- Prepare summary of discovered vulnerabilities and recommendations
- Document evidence for security assessment reporting

## 📚 Key Takeaways

**Main Concepts Learned:**

1. Network reconnaissance tools like Nmap reveal the attack surface by identifying open ports and running services on target systems.
    
2. Database servers should minimize exposed services to reduce potential attack vectors and unauthorized access opportunities.
    
3. Regular port scanning helps identify configuration drift and unauthorized services that may introduce security vulnerabilities.
    
4. Vulnerability assessment requires systematic scanning and analysis to understand network security posture and risk exposure.
    

**Real-World Application:**

- Security professionals use Nmap for penetration testing and vulnerability assessments to identify security weaknesses before attackers can exploit them.
    
- Regular network scanning is essential for maintaining security baselines and ensuring critical systems like database servers have minimal attack surface exposure.
