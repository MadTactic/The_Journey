## üìù Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Honeypot on www_stage System

- Access **www_stage** computer in DMZ environment
- Launch **Pentbox** honeypot software
- Configure honeypot services and monitoring capabilities
- Activate honeypot to begin capturing unauthorized access attempts

### Step 2: Test Honeypot from Analyst-Lap

- Access **Analyst-Lap** workstation
- Open **Google Chrome** browser
- Navigate to **www_stage.corpnet.xyz** URL
- Perform test interactions to simulate potential intrusion attempts

### Step 3: Review Intrusion Effects and Logs

- Return to **www_stage** honeypot system
- Analyze captured intrusion attempts and system interactions
- Review honeypot logs for attack patterns and methodologies
- Document evidence of unauthorized access attempts

### Step 4: Complete Assessment and Analysis

- Evaluate honeypot effectiveness in detecting test intrusion
- Complete lab assessment questions based on findings
- Document threat intelligence gathered from honeypot data

## üìö Key Takeaways

**Main Concepts Learned:**

1. Honeypots serve as early warning systems by attracting and logging unauthorized access attempts without exposing legitimate network resources.
    
2. Deception technology provides valuable threat intelligence by revealing attacker techniques, tools, and procedures in controlled environments.
    
3. DMZ placement of honeypots maximizes exposure to potential threats while maintaining isolation from critical network infrastructure.
    
4. Log analysis from honeypot systems enables security teams to understand attack patterns and improve defensive strategies.
    

**Real-World Application:**

- Security operations centers deploy honeypots to detect advanced persistent threats and gather intelligence on attacker behavior patterns.
    
- Threat hunting teams use honeypot data to develop signatures and indicators of compromise for proactive threat detection across enterprise networks.
